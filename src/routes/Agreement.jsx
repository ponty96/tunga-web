        <p>
          2.13 The User agrees that upon request of the Buyer, Tunga generates
          an invoice for the Services delivered on behalf of the Seller. These
          invoices can be found in the Tunga Account. Any international and/or
          domestic and/or local taxes will be excluded from this invoice. Any
          tax returns and/or tax assessment will be for the sole administrative
          accuracy, responsibility and risk of the User.
        </p>

        <p>
          2.14 To generate the invoice Tunga uses the Project or Task
          information that relates to the Service Contract, as well as the
          company data in the Tunga Account of the User. The User is fully
          responsible for the correctness of the Project or Task information and
          the company details in the Tunga Account.

        <p>
          2.15 Although we do our best to generate invoices that comply with all
          relevant local and international laws and regulations, it is up to
          Users to assure the correctness of the invoice and to inform us if and
          when this is not the case.

          have the same rights, powers and privileges that we have under this
          User Agreement and will be entitled to exercise or enforce their
          rights, powers and privileges as our agent or in their own name. In no
          event shall we be liable to any User for any loss, damage or liability
