          the users of our website and services.
        </p>

        <p>
          This privacy policy is applicable to all our services and the use of
          our website (https://tunga.io) and all associated products and
          services available on our website. This policy summarizes Tunga data
          collection policies and practices on the Tunga Account and our
          website. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that
          Tunga does not own or control, or to people that Tunga does not employ
          or manage.
        </p>

        <p>
          As used in this policy “Tunga” refers to Tunga B.V., a private company
          under Dutch law with is registered office in Amsterdam (Netherlands)
          and any of its subsidiaries and affiliates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tunga complies with the “Dutch Personal Data Protection Act” (Wet
          Bescherming Persoonsgegevens), the “Dutch Telecommunications Act”
          (Telecommunicatiewet ) and the codes of conduct drawn up by the DDMA
          (Dutch Dialogue Marketing Association).
        </p>

        <h3>The use of information provided by you</h3>

        <p>
          We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the
          terms of this policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you sign up for a Tunga Account, personal information, as your
          name, address, nationality, may be collected. We use this additional
          data to personalize your Tunga experience. By obtaining and using this
          information, we can provide you with the most timely, relevant and
          individualized service according to your preferences and interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data that is communicated back and forth between Tunga and your
          computer is encrypted. This means third parties are not able to
          intercept or read the data stream between Tunga and you. Tunga uses
          the same safety standards as most large marketplace websites.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you sign up with Tunga and as you use the Tunga Website, we also
          record your decision to: (1) receive e-mail updates from Tunga; and
          (2) have a third-party sponsor contact you to provide information
          regarding their product or services.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may include certain links in our e-mails that will allow us to
          monitor whether you access specific content or advertisements
          contained in that e-mail. When you click on one of these links, we
          will record that click and certain activities on the web page
          associated with that link. We use this information to conduct internal
          research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior related
          to our e-mail advertisements and content, and to better understand and
          serve you.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use log files to track system activity and maintain our systems.
          Log data includes IP addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages,
          platform type, date/time stamp, and number and nature of clicks
          through our website. We use this information primarily for security
          purposes, but also to analyze usage patterns, observe trends,
          administer the website, track user movements in the aggregate, and
          gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Information
          gathered from log files is for Tunga internal use only and will not be
          shared with any third parties, except law enforcement, when necessary
          and/or obliged. For non-member visitors of our website, log files are
          not linked to personally identifiable information.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may use your submitted e-mail address to compare our member list to
          lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending
          identical messages to our members.

        <h3>Disclosure of your information</h3>

        <p>
          We may disclose your personal information to respond to legal
          requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that your
          posting and/or other content violates the rights of others, or protect
          anyone's rights, property, or safety.
        </p>

        <p>We may also share your personal information with:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            service providers under contract who help with our business
            operations (such as marketing, investigation of unlawful activities,
            and affiliate and rewards programs);
          </li>
          <li>
            other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your
            information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and
            consent to when using a specific service).
          </li>
          <li>
            law enforcement or other governmental officials relating to alleged
            illegal activity. In such events, we will disclose information

            telephone number, e-mail address, user name history, IP address,
            complaints, postings and other content. Without limiting the above,
            in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep Tunga
            free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal
            information to law enforcement or other government officials without
            a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure,
            except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of
            information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or
            financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity;
          </li>
          <li>
            business entities, with whom we could plan to merge with or be
            acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that
            the new combined entity follow this policy with respect to your
            personal information. If your personal information will be used
            contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Change or delete personally identifiable information</h3>

        <p>
          At any time, you can refuse to permit us to collect additional
          personal information and also may request that we delete any personal
          information we have collected. Please be advised that by refusing to
          permit us to collect personal information or requesting the deletion
          from our database, you will be unsubscribing from your Tunga Account.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Amendments to this privacy policy and your acceptance of the privacy
          policy
        </h3>

        <p>
          We may amend this policy from time to time. By using the Tunga Account
          or our Website, you signify your agreement to the terms of this
          policy. In the event that there are any material changes to the way we
          collect, use and/or share personal information, we will provide you
          with notice via e-mail. In addition, we will post a link to our
          revised privacy policy on our home page so our users are always aware
          of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
          circumstances, if any, we disclose it. It is most likely that any
          material changes to this policy will be to conform with applicable
          laws.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your continued use of our services and/or website shall constitute

        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>

        <p>
          We use cookies to, among other things, persist your current session so
          you don't have to re-enter your credentials each time you visit the
          website and to deliver personalized content. We use cookies (small
          files placed on your hard drive) to analyze visits to our services and
          help us to deliver a more useful final product. These cookies may be
          from third parties (e.g. Google). At entering our website you will be
          asked for your permission for the use of our cookies. Please note that
          rejecting cookies while visiting the website may result in certain
          parts of the website not operating correctly or as efficiently as if
          they were allowed.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our
          behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known
          as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising
          effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via
          cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>

        <p>
          Tunga takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users'
          information. When you submit sensitive information via our service,
          your information is protected both online and off-line. We have
          physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal
          information about you.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Tunga
          and/or communications with other users of Tunga will not be
          intercepted by others and that information stored on our servers will
          be free from unauthorized access. While we have taken reasonable
          precautions to protect this information, you should always use
          discretion in what information you register and send to us and not
          expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion.
        </p>

        <h3>Reports</h3>

        <p>
          We periodically prepare analyses and reports reflecting visitor and
          member use of the website and our services for our internal use as
          well as for a limited number of our business partners. These reports
          include aggregate (non-personal) information about Tunga users, and in
          certain instances, visitors of the website. The information in these
          reports will not identify you individually. Our business partners who
          have access to these reports will not be able to contact you from the
          information contained in the reports.
        </p>

        <h3>Links/others websites</h3>

        <p>
          You should be aware that when you use our services or are on the
          website or when you receive e-mails, you could be directed to other
          sites beyond our control. This includes links from advertisers,
          sponsors and partners. These other websites may send their own cookies
          to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and
          may or may not have their own published privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h3>Access and control of personal information</h3>

        <p>
          If you are a registered user of Tunga, you may view, correct, and
          delete personal information by logging into your account and editing
          your profile, or by contacting our customer support. All user
          information, included that which is deleted, can be maintained in
          Tunga’s database solely for its internal use in ensuring the safety of
          the Tunga services and for disclosure to law enforcement, if
          necessary. Generally, you should be careful when providing any
          personal information available to the public.
